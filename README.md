  ## Description
 
  This is a remake of the old atari game, Space Invaders. The project is written in Python and the turle library. The music heard in the background is called, "Nague", by Machito!

  ## Installation

  To run the game, you must have Python installed on your computer. Start by cloning the repo, ```git clone http://github/guitarkeegan/space-invaders```. You will also need to instal the playsound library ```pip install playsound```. Turtle comes with installations of python, but if it doesn't work, try ```pip install turtle```. Then, open the project up in your favorite IDE and run the program!

  ## Usage

  > The challenge was to recreate the classic game using only the turtle library... My kid finds if very entertaining!

  ## Contributions
  
  I am the sole author of the project, but I learned many of the concepts from Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Course on Udemy.

  ## Issues

  Lots of issue ðŸ¤£! One day I'll come back and clean up all of the bugs.
